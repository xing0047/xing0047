### Hi ðŸ‘‹
I am currently a postgraduate on Artificial Intelligence at Nanyang Technological University. My research interests focus on unsupervised/semi-supervised learning in computer vision. Before that, I majored in BioMedical Engineering (BME) in Zhejiang University studying on embeded system design. Glad to share my thoughts with community ðŸ˜„!
